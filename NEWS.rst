0.0.1 (2019-10-29)
-------------------

* First release on PyPI.

0.1.1
-------------------

New Features
+++++++++++++

* Use duration from `nk.events_find()` as `epochs_end` in `nk.epochs_create()`
* Allow customized subsets of epoch lengths in `nk.bio_analyze()` with `window_lengths` argument
* Add `nk.find_outliers()` to identify outliers (abnormal values)
* Add utility function - `nk.check_type()` to return appropriate boolean values of input (integer, list, ndarray, pandas dataframe or pandas series)
* (experimental) Add error bars in the summary plot method to illustrate standard error of each bin


Fix Bugs
+++++++++++++

* Fix type of value in `nk.signal_formatpeaks()` to ensure slice assignment is done on the same type

0.1.2
-------------------

New Features
+++++++++++++

* Additional features for `nk.rsp_intervalrelated()`: average inspiratory and expiratory durations, inspiratory-to-expiratory (I/E) time ratio
* Add multiscale entropy measures (MSE, CMSE, RCMSE) and fractal methods (Detrended Fluctuation Analysis, Correlation Dimension) into `nk.hrv_nonlinear()` 
* Allow for data resampling in `nk.read_bitalino()`
* Add `bio_resting_8min_200hz` into database for reading with `nk.data()`
* Reading of url links in `nk.data()`
* Allow for `nk.hrv()` to compute RSA indices if respiratory data is present
* All `hrv` functions to automatically detect correct sampling rate if tuple or dict is passed as input
* Add support for PPG analysis: `nk.ppg_eventrelated()`, `nk.ppg_intervalrelated()`, `nk.ppg_analyze()`
* Add Zhao et al. (2018) method for `nk.ecg_quality()`
* Add tests for `epochs` module
* Add sub-epoch option for ECG and RSP event-related analysis:
	* users can create a smaller sub-epoch within the event-related epoch
	* the rate-related features of ECG and RSP signals are calculated over the sub-epoch
	* the remaining features are calculated over the original epoch, not the sub-epoch

Fix Bugs
+++++++++++++

* Fix propagation of values in `nk.signal_formatpeaks()` for formatting SCR column outputs generated by `eda_peaks()`
* Fix docstrings of `nk.rsp_phase()`, from "RSP_Inspiration" to "RSP_Phase"
* Update `signal_filter()` method for `rsp_clean()`: to use `sos` form, instead of `ba` form of butterworth (similar to `eda_clean()`)
