def signal_cyclesegment(signal_cleaned, cycle_indices, sampling_rate=1000, **kwargs):
    """**Segment a signal into individual cycles**

    Segment a signal (e.g. ECG, PPG, respiratory) into individual cycles (e.g. heartbeats, pulse waves, breaths).

    Parameters
    ----------
    signal_cleaned : Union[list, np.array, pd.Series]
        The cleaned signal channel, such as that returned by ``ppg_clean()`` or ``ecg_clean()``.
    cycle_indices : dict
        The samples indicating individual cycles (such as PPG peaks or ECG R-peaks), such as a dict
        returned by ``ppg_peaks()``.
    sampling_rate : int
        The sampling frequency of ``signal_cleaned`` (in Hz, i.e., samples/second). Defaults to 1000.
    **kwargs
        Other arguments to be passed.

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        A dict containing DataFrames for all segmented cycles.
    average_cycle_rate : float
        The average cycle rate (e.g. heart rate, respiratory rate) (in Hz, i.e., samples/second)
