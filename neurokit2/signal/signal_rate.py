def signal_rate(peaks, sampling_rate=1000, desired_length=None, interpolation_method="monotone_cubic"):
    """Calculate signal rate from a series of peaks.

    This function can also be called either via ``ecg_rate()``, ```ppg_rate()`` or ``rsp_rate()``
    (aliases provided for consistency).

    Parameters
    ----------
    peaks : list, array, DataFrame, Series or dict
        The samples at which the peaks occur. If an array is passed in, it is assumed that it was obtained
        with `signal_findpeaks()`. If a DataFrame is passed in, it is assumed it is of the same length
        as the input signal in which occurrences of R-peaks are marked as "1", with such containers
        obtained with e.g., ecg_findpeaks() or rsp_findpeaks().
    sampling_rate : int
        The sampling frequency of the signal that contains peaks (in Hz, i.e., samples/second). Defaults to 1000.
    desired_length : int
        By default, the returned signal rate has the same number of elements as the raw signal. If
        set to an integer, the returned signal rate will be interpolated between peaks over `desired_length`
        samples. Has no effect if a DataFrame is passed in as the `signal` argument. Defaults to None.
    interpolation_method : str
        Method used to interpolate the rate between peaks. See `signal_interpolate()`. 'monotone_cubic' is chosen
        as the default interpolation method since it ensures monotone interpolation between data points
        (i.e., it prevents physiologically implausible "overshoots" or "undershoots" in the y-direction).
        In contrast, the widely used cubic spline interpolation does not ensure monotonicity.

    Returns
    -------
    array
        A vector containing the rate.
