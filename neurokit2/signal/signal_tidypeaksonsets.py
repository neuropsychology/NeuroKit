    """**Tidy peaks and onsets**

    Tidy up PPG peaks and onsets to make them conform to the following rules:
    (i) No two points at the same time
    (ii) At least one local minimum between consecutive peaks
    (iii) At least one local maximum between consecutive onsets
    (iv) Alternates between onsets and peaks
    (v) Starts with onset, and ends with peak
    (vi) Same number of peaks and onsets

    Parameters
    ----------
    signal :  Union[list, np.array, pd.Series]
        The signal (i.e., a time series) that contains the peaks and onsets, in the form of a vector of values.
    peaks : list or array or DataFrame or Series or dict
        The samples at which the peaks occur.
    onsets : list or array or DataFrame or Series or dict
        The samples at which the onsets occur.
    method : str
        ``"Charlton2022"`` uses the approach used in the ppg-beats toolbox, Zenodo, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6037646
        This approach was designed for PPG signals.
    **kwargs
        Other keyword arguments.

    Returns
    -------
    peaks_clean : array
        The corrected peak locations.
    onsets_clean : array
        The corrected onset locations.
