    """
    Automated processing of bio signals.

    Wrapper for other bio processing functions of
    electrocardiography signals (ECG), respiration signals (RSP),
    electrodermal activity (EDA) and electromyography signals (EMG).

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : DataFrame
        The DataFrame containing all the respective signals
        (e.g., ecg, rsp, Photosensor etc.). If provided,
        there is no need to fill in the other arguments
        denoting the channel inputs. Defaults to None.
    ecg : list, array or Series
        The raw ECG channel.
    rsp : list, array or Series
        The raw RSP channel (as measured, for instance, by a
        respiration belt).
    eda : list, array or Series
        The raw EDA channel.
    emg : list, array or Series
        The raw EMG channel.
    keep : DataFrame
        Dataframe or channels to add by concatenation
        to the processed dataframe (for instance, the Photosensor channel).
    sampling_rate : int
        The sampling frequency of the signals (in Hz, i.e., samples/second).
        Defaults to 1000.

    Returns
    ----------
    bio_df : DataFrame
        DataFrames of the following processed bio features:
        - *"ECG"*: the raw signal, the cleaned signal,
        the heart rate, and the R peaks indexes.
        Also generated by `ecg_process()`.
        - *"RSP"*: the raw signal, the cleaned signal,
        the rate, and the amplitude. Also generated by `rsp_process()`.
        - *"EDA"*: the raw signal, the cleaned signal,
        the tonic component, the phasic component,
        indexes of the SCR onsets, peaks, amplitudes,
        and half-recovery times. Also generated by `eda_process()`.
        - *"EMG"*: the raw signal, the cleaned signal,
        and amplitudes. Also generated by `emg_process()`.
        - *"RSA"*: Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia features
        generated by `ecg_rsa()`, if both ECG and RSP are provided.
    bio_info : dict
        A dictionary containing the samples of peaks,
        troughs, amplitudes, onsets, offsets, periods of activation,
        recovery times of the respective processed signals.
