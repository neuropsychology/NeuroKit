def rsp_process(rsp_signal, sampling_rate=1000, method="khodadad2018"):
    """Process a respiration (RSP) signal.

    Convenience function that automatically processes a respiration signal with one of the following methods:

    - `Khodadad et al. (2018)
    <https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6579/aad7e6/meta>`_

    - `BioSPPy
    <https://github.com/PIA-Group/BioSPPy/blob/master/biosppy/signals/resp.py>`_

    Parameters
    ----------
    rsp_signal : Union[list, np.array, pd.Series]
        The raw respiration channel (as measured, for instance, by a respiration belt).
    sampling_rate : int
        The sampling frequency of `rsp_signal` (in Hz, i.e., samples/second).
    method : str
        The processing pipeline to apply. Can be one of "khodadad2018" (default) or "biosppy".

    Returns
    -------
    signals : DataFrame
        A DataFrame of same length as `rsp_signal` containing the following
        columns:
        - *"RSP_Raw"*: the raw signal.
        - *"RSP_Clean"*: the cleaned signal.
        - *"RSP_Peaks"*: the inhalation peaks marked as "1" in a list of zeros.
        - *"RSP_Troughs"*: the exhalation troughs marked as "1" in a list of zeros.
        - *"RSP_Rate"*: breathing rate interpolated between inhalation peaks.
        - *"RSP_Amplitude"*: breathing amplitude interpolated between inhalation peaks.
        - *"RSP_Phase"*: breathing phase, marked by "1" for inspiration and "0" for expiration.
        - *"RSP_PhaseCompletion"*: breathing phase completion, expressed in percentage (from 0 to 1),
        representing the stage of the current respiratory phase.
    info : dict
        A dictionary containing the samples at which inhalation peaks and exhalation troughs occur,
        accessible with the keys "RSP_Peaks", and "RSP_Troughs", respectively.
