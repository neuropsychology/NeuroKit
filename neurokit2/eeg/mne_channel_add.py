def mne_channel_add(raw, channel, channel_type=None, channel_name=None, sync_index_raw=0, sync_index_channel=0):
    """Add channel as array to MNE.

    Add a channel to a mne's Raw m/eeg file. It will basically synchronize the channel to the eeg data
    following a particular index and add it.

    Parameters
    ----------
    raw : mne.io.Raw
        Raw EEG data from MNE.
    channel : list or array
        The signal to be added.
    channel_type : str
        Channel type. Currently supported fields are 'ecg', 'bio', 'stim', 'eog', 'misc', 'seeg',
        'ecog', 'mag', 'eeg', 'ref_meg', 'grad', 'emg', 'hbr' or 'hbo'.
    channel_name : str
        Desired channel name.
    sync_index_raw : int or list
        An index (e.g., the onset of the same event marked in the same signal), in the raw data, by
        which to align the two inputs. This can be used in case the EEG data and the channel to add
        do not have the same onsets and must be aligned through some common event.
    sync_index_channel : int or list
        An index (e.g., the onset of the same event marked in the same signal), in the channel to add,
        by which to align the two inputs. This can be used in case the EEG data and the channel to add
        do not have the same onsets and must be aligned through some common event.

    Returns
    ----------
    mne.io.Raw
        Raw data in FIF format.

    Example
    ----------
    >>> import neurokit2 as nk
    >>> import mne
    >>>
    >>> # Let's say that the 42nd sample point in the EEG correspond to the 333rd point in the ECG
    >>> event_index_in_eeg = 42
    >>> event_index_in_ecg = 333
    >>>
    >>> raw = mne.io.read_raw_fif(mne.datasets.sample.data_path() + '/MEG/sample/sample_audvis_raw.fif',
    ...                           preload=True) # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> ecg = nk.ecg_simulate(length=170000)
    >>>
    >>> raw = nk.mne_channel_add(raw, ecg, sync_index_raw=event_index_in_eeg,
    ...                          sync_index_channel=event_index_in_ecg, channel_type="ecg") # doctest: +SKIP
