def mne_channel_extract(raw, what, name=None):
    """Channel array extraction from MNE.

    Select one or several channels by name and returns them in a dataframe.

    Parameters
    ----------
    raw : mne.io.Raw
        Raw EEG data.
    what : str or list
        Can be 'MEG', which will extract all MEG channels, 'EEG', which will extract all EEG channels, or 'EOG',
        which will extract all EOG channels (that is, if channel names are named with prefixes of their type e.g.,
        'EEG 001' etc. or 'EOG 061'). Provide exact a single or a list of channel's name(s) if not
        (e.g., ['124', '125']).
    name : str or list
        Useful only when extracting one channel. Can also take a list of names for renaming multiple channels,
        Otherwise, defaults to None.

    Returns
    ----------
    DataFrame
        A DataFrame or Series containing the channel(s).

    Example
    ----------
