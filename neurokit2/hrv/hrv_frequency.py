    """**Computes frequency-domain indices of Heart Rate Variability (HRV)**

    Computes frequency domain HRV metrics, such as the power in different frequency bands.

    * **ULF**: The spectral power of ultra low frequencies (by default, .0 to
      .0033 Hz). Very long signals are required for this to index to be
      extracted, otherwise, will return NaN.
    * **VLF**: The spectral power of very low frequencies (by default, .0033 to .04 Hz).
    * **LF**: The spectral power of low frequencies (by default, .04 to .15 Hz).
    * **HF**: The spectral power of high frequencies (by default, .15 to .4 Hz).
    * **VHF**: The spectral power of very high frequencies (by default, .4 to .5 Hz).
    * **LFHF**: The ratio obtained by dividing the low frequency power by the high frequency power.
    * **LFn**: The normalized low frequency, obtained by dividing the low frequency power by
      the total power.
    * **HFn**: The normalized high frequency, obtained by dividing the low frequency power by
      the total power.
    * **LnHF**: The log transformed HF.

    Note that a minimum duration of the signal containing the peaks is recommended for some HRV
    indices to be meaningful. For instance, 1, 2 and 5 minutes of high quality signal are the
    recommended minima for HF, LF and LF/HF, respectively.

    .. tip::

      We strongly recommend checking our open-access paper `Pham et al. (2021)
      <https://doi.org/10.3390/s21123998>`_ on HRV indices for more information.


    Parameters
    ----------
    peaks : dict
        Samples at which cardiac extrema (i.e., R-peaks, systolic peaks) occur.
        Can be a list of indices or the output(s) of other functions such as :func:`.ecg_peaks`,
        :func:`.ppg_peaks`, :func:`.ecg_process` or :func:`.bio_process`.
        Can also be a dict containing the keys `RRI` and `RRI_Time`
        to directly pass the R-R intervals and their timestamps, respectively.
    sampling_rate : int, optional
        Sampling rate (Hz) of the continuous cardiac signal in which the peaks occur.
    ulf : tuple, optional
        Upper and lower limit of the ultra-low frequency band. By default (0, 0.0033).
    vlf : tuple, optional
        Upper and lower limit of the very-low frequency band. By default (0.0033, 0.04).
    lf : tuple, optional
        Upper and lower limit of the low frequency band. By default (0.04, 0.15).
    hf : tuple, optional
        Upper and lower limit of the high frequency band. By default (0.15, 0.4).
    vhf : tuple, optional
        Upper and lower limit of the very-high frequency band. By default (0.4, 0.5).
    psd_method : str
        Method used for spectral density estimation. For details see :func:`.signal_power`.
        By default ``"welch"``.
    silent : bool
        If ``False``, warnings will be printed. Default to ``True``.
    show : bool
        If ``True``, will plot the power in the different frequency bands.
    normalize : bool
        Normalization of power by maximum PSD value. Default to ``True``.
        Normalization allows comparison between different PSD methods.
    order_criteria : str
        The criteria to automatically select order in parametric PSD (only used for autoregressive
        (AR) methods such as ``"burg"``). Defaults to ``None``.
    interpolation_rate : int, optional
        Sampling rate (Hz) of the interpolated interbeat intervals. Should be at least twice as
        high as the highest frequency in vhf. By default 100. To replicate Kubios defaults, set to 4.
        To not interpolate, set interpolation_rate to None (in case the interbeat intervals are already
        interpolated or when using the ``"lombscargle"`` psd_method for which interpolation is not required).
    **kwargs
        Additional other arguments.
