    """Computes frequency-domain indices of Heart Rate Variability (HRV).

    Note that a minimum duration of the signal containing the peaks is recommended for some HRV indices
    to be meaningful. For instance, 1, 2 and 5 minutes of high quality signal are the recomended
    minima for HF, LF and LF/HF, respectively. See references for details.

    Parameters
    ----------
    peaks : dict
        Samples at which cardiac extrema (i.e., R-peaks, systolic peaks) occur. Dictionary returned
        by ecg_findpeaks, ecg_peaks, ppg_findpeaks, or ppg_peaks.
    sampling_rate : int, optional
        Sampling rate (Hz) of the continuous cardiac signal in which the peaks occur. Should be at
        least twice as high as the highest frequency in vhf. By default 1000.
    ulf : tuple, optional
        Upper and lower limit of the ultra-low frequency band. By default (0, 0.0033).
    vlf : tuple, optional
        Upper and lower limit of the very-low frequency band. By default (0.0033, 0.04).
    lf : tuple, optional
        Upper and lower limit of the low frequency band. By default (0.04, 0.15).
    hf : tuple, optional
        Upper and lower limit of the high frequency band. By default (0.15, 0.4).
    vhf : tuple, optional
        Upper and lower limit of the very-high frequency band. By default (0.4, 0.5).
    psd_method : str
        Method used for spectral density estimation. For details see signal.signal_power. By default "welch".
    silent : bool
        If False, warnings will be printed. Default to True.
    show : bool
        If True, will plot the power in the different frequency bands.
    **kwargs : optional
        Other arguments.

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
        Contains frequency domain HRV metrics:
        - "*ULF*": spectral power density pertaining to ultra low frequency band i.e., .0 to .0033 Hz
        by default.
        - "*VLF*": spectral power density pertaining to very low frequency band i.e., .0033 to .04 Hz
        by default.
        - "*LF*": spectral power density pertaining to low frequency band i.e., .04 to .15 Hz by default.
        - "*HF*": spectral power density pertaining to high frequency band i.e., .15 to .4 Hz by default.
        - "*VHF*": variability, or signal power, in very high frequency i.e., .4 to .5 Hz by default.
        - "*LFHF*": the ratio of low frequency power to high frequency power.
        - "*LFn*": the normalized low frequency, obtained by dividing the low frequency power by
        the total power.
        - "*HFn*": the normalized high frequency, obtained by dividing the low frequency power by
        the total power.
        - "*LnHF*": the log transformed HF.
