    """**Computes time-domain indices of Heart Rate Variability (HRV)**

    Time-domain measures reflect the total variability of HR and are relatively indiscriminate when
    it comes to precisely quantifying the respective contributions of different underlying
    regulatory mechanisms. However, this "general" sensitivity can be seen as a positive feature
    (e.g., in exploratory studies or when specific underlying neurophysiological mechanisms are not
    the focus). Moreover, as they are easy to compute and interpret, time-domain measures are still
    among the most commonly reported HRV indices.

    The time-domain indices can be categorized into deviation-based and difference-based indices
    where the formal are calculated directly from the normal beat-to-beat intervals (normal RR
    intervals or NN intervals), and the later are derived from the difference between successive NN
    intervals.

    .. tip::
        We strongly recommend checking our open-access paper `Pham et al. (2021)
        <https://doi.org/10.3390/s21123998>`_ on HRV indices for more information.

    Parameters
    ----------
    peaks : dict
        Samples at which cardiac extrema (i.e., R-peaks, systolic peaks) occur.
        Can be a list of indices or the output(s) of other functions such as :func:`.ecg_peaks`,
        :func:`.ppg_peaks`, :func:`.ecg_process` or :func:`.bio_process`.
        Can also be a dict containing the keys `RRI` and `RRI_Time`
        to directly pass the R-R intervals and their timestamps, respectively.
    sampling_rate : int, optional
        Sampling rate (Hz) of the continuous cardiac signal in which the peaks occur. Should be at
        least twice as high as the highest frequency in vhf. By default 1000.
    show : bool
        If ``True``, will plot the distribution of R-R intervals.

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
        Contains time domain HRV metrics:

        * **MeanNN**: The mean of the RR intervals.
        * **SDNN**: The standard deviation of the RR intervals.
        * **SDANN1**, **SDANN2**, **SDANN5**: The standard deviation of average RR intervals
          extracted from n-minute segments of time series data (1, 2 and 5 by default). Note that
          these indices require a minimal duration of signal to be computed (3, 6 and 15 minutes
          respectively) and will be silently skipped if the data provided is too short.
        * **SDNNI1**, **SDNNI2**, **SDNNI5**: The mean of the standard deviations of RR intervals
          extracted from n-minute segments of time series data (1, 2 and 5 by default). Note that
          these indices require a minimal duration of signal to be computed (3, 6 and 15 minutes
          respectively) and will be silently skipped if the data provided is too short.
        * **RMSSD**: The square root of the mean of the squared successive differences between
          adjacent RR intervals. It is equivalent (although on another scale) to SD1, and
          therefore it is redundant to report correlations with both (Ciccone, 2017).
        * **SDSD**: The standard deviation of the successive differences between RR intervals.
        * **CVNN**: The standard deviation of the RR intervals (**SDNN**) divided by the mean of
          the RR intervals (**MeanNN**).
        * **CVSD**: The root mean square of successive differences (**RMSSD**) divided by
          the mean of the RR intervals (**MeanNN**).
        * **MedianNN**: The median of the RR intervals.
        * **MadNN**: The median absolute deviation of the RR intervals.
        * **MCVNN**: The median absolute deviation of the RR intervals (**MadNN**) divided by the
          median of the RR intervals (**MedianNN**).
        * **IQRNN**: The interquartile range (**IQR**) of the RR intervals.
        * **Prc20NN**: The 20th percentile of the RR intervals (Han, 2017; Hovsepian, 2015).
        * **Prc80NN**: The 80th percentile of the RR intervals (Han, 2017; Hovsepian, 2015).
        * **pNN50**: The proportion of RR intervals greater than 50ms, out of the total number of
          RR intervals.
        * **pNN20**: The proportion of RR intervals greater than 20ms, out of the total number of
          RR intervals.
        * **MinNN**: The minimum of the RR intervals (Parent, 2019; Subramaniam, 2022).
        * **MaxNN**: The maximum of the RR intervals (Parent, 2019; Subramaniam, 2022).
        * **TINN**: A geometrical parameter of the HRV, or more specifically, the baseline width of
          the RR intervals distribution obtained by triangular interpolation, where the error of
          least squares determines the triangle. It is an approximation of the RR interval
          distribution.
        * **HTI**: The HRV triangular index, measuring the total number of RR intervals divided by
          the height of the RR intervals histogram.
