def hrv(peaks, sampling_rate=1000, show=False):
    """Computes indices of Heart Rate Variability (HRV).

    Computes HRV indices in the time-, frequency-, and nonlinear domain. Note that a minimum duration
    of the signal containing the peaks is recommended for some HRV indices to be meaninful. For
    instance, 1, 2 and 5 minutes of high quality signal are the recomended minima for HF, LF and LF/HF,
    respectively. See references for details.

    Parameters
    ----------
    peaks : dict
        Samples at which cardiac extrema (i.e., R-peaks, systolic peaks) occur. Dictionary returned
        by ecg_findpeaks, ecg_peaks, ppg_findpeaks, or ppg_peaks.
    sampling_rate : int, optional
        Sampling rate (Hz) of the continuous cardiac signal in which the peaks occur. Should be at
        least twice as high as the highest frequency in vhf. By default 1000.
    show : bool, optional
        If True, returns the plots that are generates for each of the domains.

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
        Contains HRV metrics from three domains:
        - frequency
        (see `hrv_frequency <https://neurokit2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/functions.html#neurokit2.hrv.hrv_frequency>`_)
        - time (see `hrv_time <https://neurokit2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/functions.html#neurokit2.hrv.hrv_time>`_)
        - non-linear
        (see `hrv_nonlinear <https://neurokit2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/functions.html#neurokit2.hrv.hrv_nonlinear`_)
