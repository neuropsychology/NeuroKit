def ecg_quality(ecg_cleaned, rpeaks=None, sampling_rate=1000, method="averageQRS", approach=None):
    """**ECG Signal Quality Assessment**

    Assess the quality of the ECG Signal using various methods:

    * The ``"averageQRS"`` method computes a continuous index of quality of the ECG signal, by
      interpolating the distance of each QRS segment from the average QRS segment present in the *
      data. This index is therefore relative: 1 corresponds to heartbeats that are the closest to
      the average sample and 0 corresponds to the most distant heartbeat from that average sample.
      Note that 1 does not necessarily means "good": if the majority of samples are bad, than being
      close to the average will likely mean bad as well. Use this index with care and plot it
      alongside your ECG signal to see if it makes sense.

    * The ``"zhao2018"`` method (Zhao et al., 2018) extracts several signal quality indexes (SQIs):
      QRS wave power spectrum distribution pSQI, kurtosis kSQI, and baseline relative power basSQI.
      An additional R peak detection match qSQI was originally computed in the paper but left out
      in this algorithm. The indices were originally weighted with a ratio of [0.4, 0.4, 0.1, 0.1]
      to generate the final classification outcome, but because qSQI was dropped, the weights have
      been rearranged to [0.6, 0.2, 0.2] for pSQI, kSQI and basSQI respectively.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ecg_cleaned : Union[list, np.array, pd.Series]
        The cleaned ECG signal in the form of a vector of values.
    rpeaks : tuple or list
        The list of R-peak samples returned by ``ecg_peaks()``. If None, peaks is computed from
        the signal input.
    sampling_rate : int
        The sampling frequency of the signal (in Hz, i.e., samples/second).
    method : str
        The method for computing ECG signal quality, can be ``"averageQRS"`` (default) or ``"zhao2018"``.
    approach : str
        The data fusion approach as documented in Zhao et al. (2018). Can be ``"simple"``
        or ``"fuzzy"``. The former performs simple heuristic fusion of SQIs and the latter performs
        fuzzy comprehensive evaluation. If ``None`` (default), simple heuristic fusion is used.
    **kwargs
        Keyword arguments to be passed to ``signal_power()`` in the computation of basSQI and pSQI.

    Returns
    -------
    array or str
        Vector containing the quality index ranging from 0 to 1 for ``"averageQRS"`` method,
        returns string classification (``Unacceptable``, ``Barely Acceptable`` or ``Excellent``)
        of the signal for ``"zhao2018 method"``.
