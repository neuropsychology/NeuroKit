def ecg_process(ecg_signal, sampling_rate=1000, method="neurokit"):
    """Process an ECG signal.

    Convenience function that automatically processes an ECG signal.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ecg_signal : Union[list, np.array, pd.Series]
        The raw ECG channel.
    sampling_rate : int
        The sampling frequency of `ecg_signal` (in Hz, i.e., samples/second).
        Defaults to 1000.
    method : str
        The processing pipeline to apply. Defaults to "neurokit".

    Returns
    -------
    signals : DataFrame
        A DataFrame of the same length as the `ecg_signal` containing the following columns:

        - *"ECG_Raw"*: the raw signal.

        - *"ECG_Clean"*: the cleaned signal.

        - *"ECG_R_Peaks"*: the R-peaks marked as "1" in a list of zeros.

        - *"ECG_Rate"*: heart rate interpolated between R-peaks.

        - *"ECG_P_Peaks"*: the P-peaks marked as "1" in a list of zeros

        - *"ECG_Q_Peaks"*: the Q-peaks marked as "1" in a list of zeros .

        - *"ECG_S_Peaks"*: the S-peaks marked as "1" in a list of zeros.

        - *"ECG_T_Peaks"*: the T-peaks marked as "1" in a list of zeros.

        - *"ECG_P_Onsets"*: the P-onsets marked as "1" in a list of zeros.

        - *"ECG_P_Offsets"*: the P-offsets marked as "1" in a list of zeros
                            (only when method in `ecg_delineate` is wavelet).

        - *"ECG_T_Onsets"*: the T-onsets marked as "1" in a list of zeros
                            (only when method in `ecg_delineate` is wavelet).

        - *"ECG_T_Offsets"*: the T-offsets marked as "1" in a list of zeros.

        - *"ECG_R_Onsets"*: the R-onsets marked as "1" in a list of zeros
                            (only when method in `ecg_delineate` is wavelet).

        - *"ECG_R_Offsets"*: the R-offsets marked as "1" in a list of zeros
                            (only when method in `ecg_delineate` is wavelet).

        - *"ECG_Phase_Atrial"*: cardiac phase, marked by "1" for systole
          and "0" for diastole.

        - *"ECG_Phase_Ventricular"*: cardiac phase, marked by "1" for systole and "0" for diastole.

        - *"ECG_Atrial_PhaseCompletion"*: cardiac phase (atrial) completion, expressed in percentage
          (from 0 to 1), representing the stage of the current cardiac phase.

        - *"ECG_Ventricular_PhaseCompletion"*: cardiac phase (ventricular) completion, expressed in
          percentage (from 0 to 1), representing the stage of the current cardiac phase.
    info : dict
        A dictionary containing the samples at which the R-peaks occur, accessible with the key
        "ECG_Peaks".
