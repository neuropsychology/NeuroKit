    """**Find R-peaks in an ECG signal**

    Find R-peaks in an ECG signal using the specified method. The method accepts unfiltered ECG
    signals as input, although it is expected that a filtered (cleaned) ECG will result in better
    results.

    Different algorithms for peak-detection include:

    .. note::

      Please help us improve the methods' documentation by adding a small description.


    * **neurokit** (default): QRS complexes are detected based on the steepness of the absolute
      gradient of the ECG signal. Subsequently, R-peaks are detected as local maxima in
      the QRS complexes. Unpublished, but see https://github.com/neuropsychology/NeuroKit/issues/476

      al. (2015) by Rodrigues et al. (2021).
    * **promac**: ProMAC combines the result of several R-peak detectors in a probabilistic way.
      For a given peak detector, the binary signal representing the peak locations is convolved
      with a Gaussian distribution, resulting in a probabilistic representation of each peak
      location. This procedure is repeated for all selected methods and the resulting
      signals are accumulated. Finally, a threshold is used to accept or reject the peak locations.

        The cleaned ECG channel as returned by ``ecg_clean()``.

    method : string
        The algorithm to be used for R-peak detection.

    **kwargs
        Additional keyword arguments, usually specific for each method.

    Returns
    -------

        A DataFrame of same length as the input signal in which occurrences of R-peaks marked as
        ``1`` in a list of zeros with the same length as ``ecg_cleaned``. Accessible with the keys
        ``"ECG_R_Peaks"``.
    info : dict
