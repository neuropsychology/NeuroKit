def entropy_shannon(signal):
    """Shannon entropy (SE)

    Python implementation of Shannon entropy (SE). Entropy is a measure of unpredictability of the state,
    or equivalently, of its average information content. Shannon entropy (SE) is one of the first and
    most basic measure of entropy and a foundational concept of information theory. Shannonâ€™s entropy
    quantifies the amount of information in a variable.

    This function can be called either via ``entropy_shannon()`` or ``complexity_se()``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    signal : Union[list, np.array, pd.Series]
        The signal (i.e., a time series) in the form of a vector of values.


    Returns
    ----------
    float
        The Shannon entropy as float value.

    See Also
    --------
    entropy_approximate, entropy_sample, entropy_fuzzy

    Examples
    ----------
    >>> import neurokit2 as nk
    >>>
    >>> signal = nk.signal_simulate(duration=2, frequency=5)
    >>> entropy = nk.entropy_shannon(signal)
    >>> entropy #doctest: +SKIP
