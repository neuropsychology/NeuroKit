def eda_process(eda_signal, sampling_rate=1000, method="neurokit"):
    """Process Electrodermal Activity (EDA).

    Convenience function that automatically processes electrodermal activity (EDA) signal.

    Parameters
    ----------
    eda_signal : Union[list, np.array, pd.Series]
        The raw EDA signal.
    sampling_rate : int
        The sampling frequency of `rsp_signal` (in Hz, i.e., samples/second).
    method : str
        The processing pipeline to apply. Can be one of "biosppy" or "neurokit" (default).

    Returns
    -------
    signals : DataFrame
        A DataFrame of same length as `eda_signal` containing the following
        columns:

        - *"EDA_Raw"*: the raw signal.

        - *"EDA_Clean"*: the cleaned signal.

        - *"EDA_Tonic"*: the tonic component of the signal, or the Tonic Skin Conductance Level (SCL).

        - *"EDA_Phasic"*: the phasic component of the signal, or the Phasic Skin Conductance Response (SCR).

        - *"SCR_Onsets"*: the samples at which the onsets of the peaks occur, marked as "1" in a list of zeros.

        - *"SCR_Peaks"*: the samples at which the peaks occur, marked as "1" in a list of zeros.

        - *"SCR_Height"*: the SCR amplitude of the signal including the Tonic component. Note that cumulative
          effects of close- occurring SCRs might lead to an underestimation of the amplitude.

        - *"SCR_Amplitude"*: the SCR amplitude of the signal excluding the Tonic component.

        - *"SCR_RiseTime"*: the time taken for SCR onset to reach peak amplitude within the SCR.

        - *"SCR_Recovery"*: the samples at which SCR peaks recover (decline) to half amplitude, marked
          as "1" in a list of zeros.
    info : dict
        A dictionary containing the information of each SCR peak (see `eda_findpeaks()`).
