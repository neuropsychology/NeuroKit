    """Clean a photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal.

    Prepare a raw PPG signal for systolic peak detection.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ppg_signal : Union[list, np.array, pd.Series]
        The raw PPG channel.
    sampling_rate : int
        The sampling frequency of the PPG (in Hz, i.e., samples/second). The default is 1000.
    method : str
        The processing pipeline to apply. Can be one of "elgendi". The default is "elgendi".

    Returns
    -------
    clean : array
        A vector containing the cleaned PPG.
