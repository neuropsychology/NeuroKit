def ppg_plot(ppg_signals, sampling_rate=None):
    """Visualize photoplethysmogram (PPG) data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ppg_signals : DataFrame
        DataFrame obtained from `ppg_process()`.
    sampling_rate : int
        The sampling frequency of the PPG (in Hz, i.e., samples/second). Needs to be supplied if the data
        should be plotted over time in seconds. Otherwise the data is plotted over samples. Defaults to None.

    Returns
    -------
    fig
        Figure representing a plot of the processed PPG signals.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import neurokit2 as nk
    >>>
    >>> # Simulate data
    >>> ppg = nk.ppg_simulate(duration=10, sampling_rate=1000, heart_rate=70)
    >>>
    >>> # Process signal
    >>> signals, info = nk.ppg_process(ppg, sampling_rate=1000)
    >>>
    >>> # Plot
    >>> nk.ppg_plot(signals) #doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    <Figure ...>
