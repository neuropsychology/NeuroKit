    """**Process a photoplethysmogram (PPG)  signal**

    Convenience function that automatically processes a photoplethysmogram signal.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ppg_signal : Union[list, np.array, pd.Series]
        The raw PPG channel.
    sampling_rate : int
        The sampling frequency of :func:`.ppg_signal` (in Hz, i.e., samples/second).
    method : str
        The processing pipeline to apply. Can be one of ``"elgendi"``.
        Defaults to ``"elgendi"``.
    report : str
        The filename of a report containing description and figures of processing
        (e.g. ``"myreport.html"``). Needs to be supplied if a report file
        should be generated. Defaults to ``None``.
    **kwargs
        Other arguments to be passed to specific methods. For more information,
        see :func:`.ppg_methods`.

    Returns
    -------
    signals : DataFrame
        A DataFrame of same length as :func:`.ppg_signal` containing the following columns:

        * ``"PPG_Raw"``: the raw signal.
        * ``"PPG_Clean"``: the cleaned signal.
        * ``"PPG_Rate"``: the heart rate as measured based on PPG peaks.
        * ``"PPG_Peaks"``: the PPG peaks marked as "1" in a list of zeros.

    info : dict
        A dictionary containing the information of peaks and the signals' sampling rate.
