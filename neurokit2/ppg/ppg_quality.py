    """**PPG Signal Quality Assessment**

    Assess the quality of the PPG Signal using various methods:

    * The ``"templatematch"`` method (loosely based on Orphanidou et al., 2015) computes a continuous
      index of quality of the PPG signal, by calculating the correlation coefficient between each
      individual pulse wave and an average (template) pulse wave shape. This index is therefore
      relative: 1 corresponds to pulse waves that are closest to the average pulse wave shape (i.e.
      correlate exactly with it) and 0 corresponds to there being no correlation with the average
      pulse wave shape.

    * The ``"disimilarity"`` method (loosely based on Sabeti et al., 2019) computes a continuous index
      of quality of the PPG signal, by calculating the level of disimilarity between each individual 
      pulse wave and an average (template) pulse wave shape (after they are normalised). A value of
      zero indicates no disimilarity (i.e. equivalent pulse wave shapes), whereas values above or below
      indicate increasing disimilarity. The original method used dynamic time-warping to align the pulse
      waves prior to calculating the level of dsimilarity, whereas this implementation does not currently
      include this step.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ppg_cleaned : Union[list, np.array, pd.Series]
        The cleaned PPG signal in the form of a vector of values.
    peaks : tuple or list
        The list of PPG pulse wave peak samples returned by ``ppg_peaks()``. If None, peaks is computed from
        the signal input.
    sampling_rate : int
        The sampling frequency of the signal (in Hz, i.e., samples/second).
    method : str
        The method for computing PPG signal quality, can be ``"templatematch"`` (default).

    Returns
    -------
    quality : array
        Vector containing the quality index ranging from 0 to 1 for ``"templatematch"`` method,
        or an unbounded value (where 0 indicates high quality) for ``"disimilarity"`` method.
