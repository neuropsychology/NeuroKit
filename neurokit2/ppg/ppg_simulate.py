    """Simulate a photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal.

    Phenomenological approximation of PPG. The PPG wave is described with four landmarks: wave onset,
    location of the systolic peak, location of the dicrotic notch and location of the diastolic peaks.
    These landmarks are defined as x and y coordinates (in a  time series). These coordinates are
    then interpolated at the desired sampling rate to obtain the PPG signal.

    Parameters
    ----------
    duration : int
        Desired recording length in seconds. The default is 120.
    sampling_rate : int
        The desired sampling rate (in Hz, i.e., samples/second). The default is 1000.
    heart_rate : int
        Desired simulated heart rate (in beats per minute). The default is 70.
    frequency_modulation : float
        Float between 0 and 1. Determines how pronounced respiratory sinus arrythmia (RSA) is
        (0 corresponds to absence of RSA). The default is 0.3.
    ibi_randomness : float
        Float between 0 and 1. Determines how much random noise there is in the duration of each
        PPG wave (0 corresponds to absence of variation). The default is 0.1.
    drift : float
        Float between 0 and 1. Determines how pronounced the baseline drift (.05 Hz) is
        (0 corresponds to absence of baseline drift). The default is 1.
    motion_amplitude : float
        Float between 0 and 1. Determines how pronounced the motion artifact (0.5 Hz) is
        (0 corresponds to absence of motion artifact). The default is 0.1.
    powerline_amplitude : float
        Float between 0 and 1. Determines how pronounced the powerline artifact (50 Hz) is
        (0 corresponds to absence of powerline artifact). Note that powerline_amplitude > 0 is only
        possible if 'sampling_rate' is >= 500. The default is 0.1.
    burst_amplitude : float
        Float between 0 and 1. Determines how pronounced high frequency burst artifacts are
        (0 corresponds to absence of bursts). The default is 1.
    burst_number : int
        Determines how many high frequency burst artifacts occur. The default is 0.
    show : bool
        If true, returns a plot of the landmarks and interpolated PPG. Useful for debugging.
    random_state : int
        Seed for the random number generator. Keep it fixed for reproducible results.

    Returns
    -------
    ppg : array
        A vector containing the PPG.
