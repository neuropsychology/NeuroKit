    """Find and select events in a continuous signal (e.g., from a photosensor).

    Parameters
    ----------
    event_channel : array or list
        The channel containing the events.
    threshold : str or float
        The threshold value by which to select the events. If "auto", takes the value between the max
        and the min.
    threshold_keep : str
        "above" or "below", define the events as above or under the threshold. For photosensors, a
        white screen corresponds usually to higher values. Therefore, if your events are signaled by
        a black colour, events values are the lower ones, and you should set the cut to "below".
    start_at : int
        Keep events which onset is after a particular time point.
    end_at : int
        Keep events which onset is before a particular time point.
    duration_min : int
        The minimum duration of an event to be considered as such (in time points).
    duration_max : int
        The maximum duration of an event to be considered as such (in time points).
    inter_min : int
        The minimum duration after an event for the subsequent event to be considered as such (in time
        points). Useful when spurious consecutive events are created due to very high sampling rate.
    discard_first : int
        Discard first or last n events. Useful if the experiment starts with some spurious events.
        If discard_first=0, no first event is removed.
    discard_last : int
        Discard first or last n events. Useful if the experiment ends with some spurious events.
        If discard_last=0, no last event is removed.
    event_labels : list
        A list containing unique event identifiers. If `None`, will use the event index number.
    event_conditions : list
        An optional list containing, for each event, for example the trial category, group or
        experimental conditions.

    Returns
    ----------
    dict
        Dict containing 3 or 4 arrays, 'onset' for event onsets, 'duration' for event durations, 'label'
        for the event identifiers and the optional 'conditions' passed to `event_conditions`.
