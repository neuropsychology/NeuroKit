**The Python Toolbox for Neurophysiological Signal Processing**

This package is the continuation of `NeuroKit 1 <https://github.com/neuropsychology/NeuroKit.py>`_.
It's a user-friendly package providing easy access to advanced biosignal processing routines.
Researchers and clinicians without extensive knowledge of programming or biomedical signal processing
can **analyze physiological data with only two lines of code**.


Quick Example
------------------

.. code-block:: python

    import neurokit2 as nk  
    
    # Download example data
    data = nk.data("bio_eventrelated_100hz")
    
    # Preprocess the data (filter, find peaks, etc.)
    processed_data, info = nk.bio_process(ecg=data["ECG"], rsp=data["RSP"], eda=data["EDA"], sampling_rate=100)
    
    # Compute relevant features
    results = nk.bio_analyze(processed_data, sampling_rate=100)  

And **boom** ðŸ’¥ your analysis is done ðŸ˜Ž

    Design
    --------

    *NeuroKit2* is designed to provide a **consistent**, **accessible** yet **powerful** and **flexible** API. 

    - **Consistency**: For each type of signals (ECG, RSP, EDA, EMG...), the same function names are called (in the form :code:`signaltype_functiongoal()`) to achieve equivalent goals, such as :code:`*_clean()`, :code:`*_findpeaks()`, :code:`*_process()`, :code:`*_plot()` (replace the star with the signal type, e.g., :code:`ecg_clean()`).
    - **Accessibility**: Using NeuroKit2 is made very easy for beginners through the existence of powerful high-level "master" functions, such as :code:`*_process()`, that performs cleaning, preprocessing and processing with sensible defaults.
    - **Flexibility**: However, advanced users can very easily build their own custom analysis pipeline by using the mid-level functions (such as :code:`*_clean()`, :code:`*_rate()`), offering more control and flexibility over their parameters.

Analysis
----------


The analysis of physiological data usually comes in two types, **event-related** or **interval-related**.

Event-related
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This type of analysis refers to physiological changes immediately occurring in response to an event.
For instance, physiological changes following the presentation of a stimulus (e.g., an emotional stimulus).
In this situation the analysis is epoch-based. An epoch is a short chunk of the physiological signal
(usually < 10 seconds), that is locked to a specific stimulus. In this case, using `bio_analyze()` will
compute the following features:

- **Features:**

  - **Rate changes** *(ECG, PPG, RSP)*: mean, minimum, maximum, minimum-time and maximum-time
  - **Peak characteristics** *(EDA)*: peak presence, amplitude, rise time, peak-time
  - **Phase characteristics** *(ECG, RSP)*: phase type (inspiration/expiration, systole/diastole), phase completion
  - ...
  
- `Full example <https://neurokit2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/eventrelated.html>`_

Interval-related
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This type of analysis refers to the physiological characteristics and features that occur over
longer periods of time (from a few seconds to days of activity). Typical use cases are either
periods of resting-state, in which the activity is recorded for several minutes while the participant
is at rest, or during different conditions in which there is no specific time-locked event
(e.g., watching movies, listening to music, engaging in physical activity, etc.). For instance,
this type of analysis is used when people want to compare the physiological activity under different
intensities of physical exercise, different types of movies, or different intensities of
stress. In this case, using `bio_analyze()` will compute the following features:

- **Features:**

  - **Rate characteristics** *(ECG, PPG, RSP)*: mean, amplitude, variability (HRV, RRV)
  - **Peak characteristics** *(EDA)*: number of peaks, mean amplitude
  - ...
