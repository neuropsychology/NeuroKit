Contributing guide
===================

**NeuroKit2 welcomes everyone to contribute to code, documentation, testing and suggestions.**

This package aims at being beginner-friendly. And if you're not yet familiar with how contribution can be done to open-source packages, or with **how to use GitHub**, this guide is for you!

**Let's dive right into it!**




NeuroKit's style
------------------


Structure and code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- The NeuroKit package is organized into submodules, such as *ecg*, *signal*, *statistics*, etc. New functions should be created within at the appropriate places.
- The API (the functions) should be consistent, with functions starting with a prefix (`plot_`, `ecg_`, `eda_`, etc.) so that the user can easily find them by typing the "intuitive" prefix.
- Authors of code contribution are invited to follow the `PEP 8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ style sheet to write some nice (and readable) python.
- That being said, *human readability* should always be favoured over anything else. Ideally, we would like the code in NeuroKit to be understandable even by non-programmers.
- Contrary to Python recommendations, we prefer some nicely nested loops, rather than complex one-liners `["that" for s if h in i for t in range("don't") if "understand" is False]`.
- The maximum **line length** is 100 characters
- Please *document and comment* your code, so that the purpose of each step (or code line) is stated in a clear and understandable way.
- Don't forget to add tests and documentation (a description, examples, etc.) to your functions.

Run code checks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you're satisfied by the code you've written, you will need to run some checks to make sure it is "standardized". You will need to open the command line and install the following packages:

.. code-block::

    pip install isort black docformatter flake8 pylint 

Now, navigate to the folder where your script is by typing ``cd C:\the\folder\of\my\file``. Once you there, you can run the following commands:

.. code-block::

    isort myfile.py -l 120  --balanced --multi-line 3 --lines-between-types 1 --lines-after-imports 2 --trailing-comma
    black myfile.py --line-length 120
    docformatter myfile.py --wrap-summaries 120 --wrap-descriptions 113 --blank --in-place
    
    flake8 myfile.py --max-line-length=127 --max-complexity=10 --ignore E303,C901,E203,W503
    pylint myfile.py --max-line-length=127 --load-plugins=pylint.extensions.docparams --load-plugins=pylint.extensions.docstyle --variable-naming-style=any --argument-naming-style=any --reports=n --suggestion-mode=y --disable=E303 --disable=R0913 --disable=R0801 --disable=C0114 --disable=E203 --disable=E0401 --disable=W9006 --disable=C0330 --disable=R0914 --disable=R0912 --disable=R0915 --disable=W0102 --disable=W0511 --disable=C1801 --disable=C0111 --disable=R1705 --disable=R1720 --disable=C0301 --disable=C0415 --disable=C0103 --disable=C0302 --disable=R1716 --disable=W0632 --disable=E1136 --extension-pkg-whitelist=numpy
The first three commands will make some modifications to your code so that it is nicely formatted, while the two last will run some checks to detect any additional issues. Please try to fix them!

*PS:* If you want to check the whole package (i.e., all the files of the package), run:

.. code-block::

    isort neurokit2 -l 120 --balanced --multi-line 3 --lines-between-types 1 --lines-after-imports 2 --trailing-comma --skip neurokit2/complexity/__init__.py --recursive 
    black neurokit2 --line-length 120
    docformatter neurokit2 --wrap-summaries 120 --wrap-descriptions 113 --blank --in-place --recursive
    
    flake8 neurokit2 --exclude neurokit2/__init__.py --max-line-length=127 --max-complexity=10 --ignore E303,C901,E203,W503
    pylint neurokit2 --max-line-length=127 --load-plugins=pylint.extensions.docparams --load-plugins=pylint.extensions.docstyle --variable-naming-style=any --argument-naming-style=any --reports=n --suggestion-mode=y --disable=E303 --disable=R0913 --disable=R0801 --disable=C0114 --disable=E203 --disable=E0401 --disable=W9006 --disable=C0330 --disable=R0914 --disable=R0912 --disable=R0915 --disable=W0102 --disable=W0511 --disable=C1801 --disable=C0111 --disable=R1705 --disable=R1720 --disable=C0301 --disable=C0415 --disable=C0103 --disable=C0302 --disable=R1716 --disable=W0632 --disable=E1136 --extension-pkg-whitelist=numpy --exit-zero

Avoid Semantic Errors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Most errors detected by our code checks can be easily automated with ``isort``, ``black``, and ``docformatter``. This leaves us with the semantic errors picked up by ``pylint``, the last style check, which often have to be fixed manually. Below is a list of the most common semantic errors that occur when writing code/documentation, so before you commit any changes, do make sure you have fixed these.

**Documentation**

- Missing function arguments in ``Parameters`` and ``Returns``. 
- In internal functions, missing ``Returns`` section detected only if ``Parameters`` is documented but is not followed by returns documentation.
- Failure to detect documentation of arguments when they are done simultaneously in one line:

.. code-block::

     a, b, c, discard, n, sampling_rate, x0 : int

will result in a ``pylint`` error like ``a, b, c, discard, n, sampling_rate, x0" missing in parameter documentation (missing-param-doc)`` so do document each argument separately.
 
- Argument name different from documentation


**Code**

- Unused arguments
- Unused variables
- Merge ``if`` arguments, for example: ``if isinstance(ecg, (list, pd.Series))`` rather than ``if isinstance(ecg, list) or isinstance(ecg, pd.Series)``
  





Development workflow
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The NeuroKit GitHub repository has two main branches, **master** and the **dev**. The typical workflow is to work and make changes **on the dev branch**. This dev branch has a pull request (PR) opened to track individual commits (changes). And every now and then (when a sufficient number of changes have been made), the dev branch is **merged into master**, leading to an update of the version number and an upload to PyPi.

The important thing is that you should **not directly make changes on the master branch**, because *master* is usually behind *dev* (which means for instance, maybe the the things you are changing on *master* have already been changed on *dev*). The *master* should be a stable, tested branch, and *dev* is the place to experiment.

This is a summary of the typical workflow for contributing using GitHub (a detailed guide is available below):

1. Download `GitHub Desktop <https://desktop.github.com/>`_ and follow the small tutorial that it proposes
2. *Fork* the NeuroKit repository (this can be done on the GitHub website page by clicking on the *Fork* button), and clone it using GitHub Desktop to your local computer (it will copy over the whole repo from GitHub to your local machine)
3. In GitHub Desktop, switch to the *dev* branch. You are now on the *dev* branch (of your own fork)
4. From there, create a new branch, called for example "bugfix-functionX" or "feature-readEEG" or "typofix"
5. Make some changes and push them (this will update **your** fork)
6. Create a pull request (PR) from your fork to the "origin" (the original repo) *dev* branch
7. This will trigger automated checks that you can explore and fix
8. Wait for it to be merged into dev, and later see it being merged into master













How to use GitHub to contribute
----------------------------------

Step 1: Fork it
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A *fork* is a copy of a repository. Working with the fork allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

Hit the **Fork** button in the top right corner of the page and in a few seconds, you will have a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account.

.. image:: https://raw.github.com/neuropsychology/NeuroKit/dev/docs/img/fork.png

Now, that is the *remote* copy of the project. The next step is to make a *local* copy in your computer. 

While you can explore Git to manage your Github developments, we recommend downloading `Github Desktop <https://desktop.github.com/>`_ instead. It makes the process way easier and more straightforward.


Step 2: Clone it
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Cloning allows you to make a *local* copy of any repositories on Github. 

Go to **File** menu, click **Clone Repository** and since you have forked Neurokit2, you should be able to find it easily under **Your repositories**. 

.. image:: https://raw.github.com/neuropsychology/NeuroKit/dev/docs/img/clone_nk.PNG

Choose the local path of where you want to save your *local* copy and as simple as that, you have a working repository in your computer.


Step 3: Find it and fix it
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

And here is where the fun begins. You can start contributing by fixing a bug (or even a typo in the code) that has been annoying you. Or you can go to the `issue section <https://github.com/neuropsychology/NeuroKit/issues/>`_ to hunt for issues that you can address. 

For example, here, as I tried to run the example in `ecg_fixpeaks()` file, I ran into a bug! A typo error!

.. image:: https://raw.github.com/neuropsychology/NeuroKit/dev/docs/img/fix_typo.gif

Fix it and hit the save button! That's one contribution I made to the package!

To save the changes you made (e.g. the typo that was just fixed) to your *local* copy of the repository, the next step is to *commit* it.


Step 4: Commit it and push it
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In your Github Desktop, you will now find the changes that you made highlighted in **red** (removed) or **green** (added). 

The first thing that you have to do is to switch from the default - *Commit to Master* to *Commit to dev*. Always commit to your dev branch as it is the branch with the latest changes. Then give the changes you made a good and succinct title and hit the *Commit* button.

.. image:: https://raw.github.com/neuropsychology/NeuroKit/dev/docs/img/commit.png

**Committing** allows your changes to be saved in your *local* copy of the repository and in order to have the changes saved in your **remote** copy, you have to **push** the commit that you just made.


Step 4: Create pull request
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The last step to make your contribution official is to create a pull request. 

.. image:: https://raw.github.com/neuropsychology/NeuroKit/dev/docs/img/pr.png

Go to your *remote* repository on Github page, the *New Pull Request* button is located right on top of the folders. Do remember to change your branch to *dev* since your commits were pushed to the dev branch previously. 

And now, all that is left is for the maintainers of the package to review your work and they can either request additional changes or merge it to the original repository. 


Step 5: Let's do it
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let's do it for real! If you have a particular feature in mind that you would want to add, we would recommend first opening an `issue <https://github.com/neuropsychology/NeuroKit/issues>`_ to let us know, so we can eventually guide you and give you some advice. And if you don't know where to start or what to do, then read our `ideas for first contributions <https://neurokit2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/first_contribution.html>`_. Good luck 💪
